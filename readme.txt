THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ARCHIVED

This project has been archived for historical purposes.

HISTORY:
This project was the original project and the basis for ExperienceEngine. It was also my first project to do graphics.

This was just a hobby project for me, at least I thought so.

I first came into contact with graphics programming concepts and started this project as a fun project in 2022. During 2023, I did not develop this project. By the way, I learned them on opengl-tutorial.org. Really grateful to the people who created that great resource!

By November 2024, when I was in University majoring in Information Technology, the program required us to develop an application as a major assignment. And so, this project was restarted. Of course the result was only decent, but it was still enough to get me a B, which was a bit of a relief.

Now, ExperienceEngine is based on this program's code. It's very different, but the basic concepts are still the same.

If you want to compile, the good news is that it compiles fine, but only with GCC, not MSVC or Clang

Anyway, enjoy. Remember to credit me if you take code from this project.

ExperienceEngine is still in its earliest stages of development and I'll post the full source code when it's ready!
